/* Q12: In this question, you will explore the connection between number of wins and attendance.
        - Does there appear to be any correlation between attendance at home games and number of wins?   
        - Do teams that win the world series see a boost in attendance the following year? What about 
	    teams that made the playoffs? Making the playoffs means either being a division winner or a 
	    wild card winner. */
