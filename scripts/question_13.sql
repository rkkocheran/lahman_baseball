/* Q13
   It is thought that since left-handed pitchers are more rare, causing batters to face them less often,
   they are more effective. Investigate this claim and present evidence to either support or dispute this claim.
   First, determine just how rare left-handed pitchers are compared with right-handed pitchers.
   Are left-handed pitchers more likely to win the Cy Young Award (Best Pitcher in MLB)?
   Are they more likely to make it into the hall of fame? */

/* What percentage of strikeouts were achieved by left-handed pitchers?
   Conclusion: 27% of total strikeouts were achieved by left-handed pitchers, which 
   correlates closely with the total % of left-handed pitchers who've ever played. 
   Therefore there seems to be no correlation between pitching left-handed and 
   achieving strikeouts. A similar lack of correlation seems to exist for most other 
   relevent pitching stats, disproving the theory that left-handed pitchers are more 
   effective. */
